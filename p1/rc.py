Title: Redundancy Detector

Objective of challenge:
write a program that reads all the files in a specified
directory and prints a report of the lines
that are identical in any pair of files

Output expected:
-------------------------------------
File 1: <f1>
File 2: <f2>
Number of identical lines: <n>
-------------------------------------
*** <line_num_f1> < line_num_f2> <line_contents>
*** <line_num_f1> < line_num_f2> <line_contents>

Description:

To fix:
-reducing garbage & improving efficiency
-test against .py, .txt and .csv
-remove test path
