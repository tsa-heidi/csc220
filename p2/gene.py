'''
Objective: given two strings representing snippets of genes (letters ACGT),
identify the shortest string that could contain them both as subsequences.


********************************************
string 1 – AACCTGT     string 2 – CTGTACG
shortest string that has both as substring
AACCTGTACG (length 10)
********************************************

The submission:

successfully reads in a pair of strings
outputs a string that contains both input strings as a subsequence
checks to ensure input is valid before beginning calculation; if not, throws an exception
Second level (2 points)

The submission:

correctly reports the length of the shortest string that contains both input strings
as a subsequence (but possibly fails to return the string itself)
is at least as efficient as the recursive solution i.e. no worse than O(2^n)
Third level (2 points)

The submission:

is more efficient than the recursive solution
correctly returns the shortest string that contains both input strings as a subsequence
*Note* to get efficiency-related points, you must include a brief discussion of the program's efficiency in your README
